    <h2>How to make a pineapple juice</h2>
    <p>This pineapple juice is one of my favorite juices. I like it because aside from the nutritional benefits, it takes less time to make</p>
    <p>Today I will be sharing with you how I make this juice</p>

    <h3>Lists of ingredients for Pineapple juice</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh and sweet pineapple</li>
        <li>A medium sized lemon</li>
        <li>small sized ginger</li>
        <li>Clean drinkable water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to make my super simple pineapple juice</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Wash the pineapple, lemon and ginger thoroughly under running water</li>
        <li>Peel the skin and set aside in a clean bowl. Also peel the ginger skin if you want</li>
        <li>Cut open the pineapple and remove the core and add it to the pineapple peel</li>
        <li>Now cut the main pineapple into small chunks</li>
        <li>Place your pineapple and the ginger in a food processor, blend and set aside in clean bowl</li>
        <li>In a clean pot, pour in the pineapple peel and core, add some water and cook for 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Sieve your blended pineapple in a clothe sieve or thinly perforated sieve</li>
        <li>Extract the water from the cooked pineapple peel and pour the extracted water into the already sieved pineapple juice and stir properly</li>
        <li>Cut and squeeze the lemon juice into the pineapple juice and stir very well</li>
        <li>Leave to cook off in the refrigerator and serve chilled</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Side note</h3>
    <p><em>The pineapple peel and core has great nutritional benefits that's why I don't just throw it away but you can do without it if you want
        <br>and your juice will still come out nicely.
