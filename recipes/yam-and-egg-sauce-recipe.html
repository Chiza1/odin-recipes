        <h2>How to make yam and egg sauce</h2>
        <p>Yam and egg sauce is a Nigerian dish that is commonly eaten as breakfast in most homes. 
            <br> The dish contains nicely peeled and sliced yam (A starchy edible root of the Dioscorea genus that is mainly grown in Africa),
        <br>some eggs and fresh vegetables. In this tutorial I'll be walking you through how to to prepare this sumptuous and healthy meal. </p>

        <h3><u>Lists of ingredients needed to make yam and egg sauce</u></h3>
        <p>The quantity of ingredients can be adjusted according to the size of your family</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A medium sized tuber of yam</li>
            <li>Four raw eggs</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil. I usually add more oil than I would need if I were making scrambled eggs</li>
            <li>Fresh tomatoes and some fresh pepper</li>
            <li>Green, yellow and red bell peppers</li>
            <li>Onions and some salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

       <h3><u>How to cook yam and egg sauce</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel off the yam skin and cut to your desired shapes and sizes</li>
            <li>Wash the yam properly, place in a deep pot, add some water and some salt to taste</li>
            <li>Place the pot on the fire and allow it to cook.
            <li>While the yam is boiling, it's time to wash and cut all your vegetables. Cut the vegetables to your preferred shapes and sizes.
                <br>The tomatoes and pepper should be in a separate bowl. Likewise the onion
            </li>
            <li>Once you are done with the vegetables, you should start making the egg sauce. So now place a pan on the fire</li> 
            <li>Once it's heated, add your vegetable oil and allow it to heat. Remember to keep an eye on the yam. You'll know it's cooked when it becomes soft and tender.
                <br> Careful not to over cook it though</li>
            <li>On the hot oil, add the onion, stir for some minutes and add the cut tomatoes and pepper and stir from time to time</li>
            <li>Allow the excess water in the tomatoes and pepper to get dried, beat and add the eggs. <strong>DO NOT STIR IMMEDIATELY</strong>. Ok this might sound like a warning but it isn't that serious.
                <br>It's just so that the egg can have some chunks &#128516; but feel free to do whatever you like.</li>
            <li>Stir and add some salt to taste. Some people like to add seasoning cubes but this is completely optional</li>
            <li>Stir and allow it to cook for some minutes and then bring it down</li>
            <li>By now your yam should be properly cooked but you can use a fork to confirm. Bring it down and sieve the excess water and set aside</li> 
            <li>Add some pieces of yam to a flat plate, pour in some of the sauce and serve &#128523; </li> 

        </ol>
