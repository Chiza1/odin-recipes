    <h2>how to make grilled chicken</h2>
    <p>I recently learnt how to grill chicken in an oven and ever since then I make grilled chicken every other weekend</p>
    <p>Making grilled chicken is easy and I'm going to sharing my recipe with you. <br>You can make this any day of the week, during the weekends or when your friends come visiting and you don't know what to entertain them with</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients for making grilled chicken</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole soft chicken. <br>Some breeds of chicken are easier to cook than others so you'd want to go for the one that is soft. You can use chicken parts if you want</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic and ginger powder</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
        <li>Thyme and curry</li>
        <li>Seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>Salt and vegetables for decoration (Any vegetable of choice)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to prepare grilled chicken in an oven</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash your chicken thoroughly under running water and set aside</li>
        <li>Mix the garlic, ginger, onion powder. thyme and curry together in a dry bowl</li>
        <li>Add salt and seasoning cubes to the mix and mix thoroughly</li>
        <li>Put on a kitchen glove or use your hands if you want but because of the pepper in the mix, a glove will be your best bet</li>
        <li>Gently massage the whole chicken with vegetable oil. Remember the inner parts if you are using a whole chicken</li>
        <li>Now start applying the ingredient mix to every parts of the chicken. Make sure to coat every parts of the chicken with the mix</li>
        <li>Once you are done, place it in the fridge for 1-2hrs so it marinates a little</li>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven and place the chicken in the oven</li>
        <li>Take it off every 45 minutes and coat it with some vegetable oil. If needed, reapply the ingredient mix each time</li>
        <li>Once the chicken turns brown like the picture above, it should be fully cooked</li>
        <li>Take it out, place in a tray/big plate and decorate with the vegetables and serve</li>
    </ol>
    <p><i>You can pair with some fried chips and ketchup</i></p>
